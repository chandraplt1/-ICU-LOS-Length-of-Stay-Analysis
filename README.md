# ICU Length of Stay Analysis using MIMIC Data

This project explores patient demographics and ICU length of stay (LOS) patterns using the MIMIC dataset. It uses public clinical data to reveal insights across age, gender, and stay duration.

## ðŸ“Š Objective

To analyze how factors such as patient age and gender impact the length of ICU stays.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

- Most patients aged **70+** tend to have **longer ICU stays**.
- **Female patients** show a slightly higher median LOS than males.
- The **majority of patients** had **short stays** (<2 days), especially in younger age groups.
